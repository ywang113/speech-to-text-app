# Description
This is a part of dementia audio data collection project in the University of Tasmania.\
Speech-to-text application is designed to improve transcription process of audio files from patients with dementia.\
Since speechs of people with dementia tend to be hard to understand, transcripting work is often time comsuming and labour intensive work.\
Therefore, this application is designed for those researchers and transcriptors.\
Not only for this purpose, this application can be used for any other audio files. \
This app is originally designed for the data collected form following 'Cookie Jar Test'.\
